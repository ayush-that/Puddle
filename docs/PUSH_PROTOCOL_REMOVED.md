- Create piggy banks with multi-sig
- Deposit funds
- Request withdrawals
- Approve withdrawals
- Multi-signature execution

## ‚ùå **Features Removed**

### **Notifications**

- ~~Push notifications for deposits~~
- ~~Push notifications for withdrawals~~
- ~~Push notifications for goal milestones~~
- ~~Push notifications for invitations~~
- ~~Notification bell UI component~~

### **Chat**

- ~~Partner chat functionality~~
- ~~Chat window UI component~~
- ~~Real-time messaging~~

---

## üìä **Alternative Solutions**

### **Option 1: Console Logging (Current)**

All notification events are now logged to the console:

```typescript
console.log("Deposit recorded successfully:", {
  amount,
  piggyBankName,
  newTotal,
});
```

### **Option 2: Email Notifications (Future)**

Consider implementing email notifications using:

- **SendGrid**
- **Resend**
- **AWS SES**

### **Option 3: In-App Notifications (Future)**

Build custom in-app notification system:

- Store notifications in database
- Display in a notification panel
- Mark as read/unread

### **Option 4: Re-add Push Protocol (When Funded)**

If you acquire 50 PUSH tokens:

1. Restore from git history
2. Create Push Protocol channel
3. Add environment variables
4. Re-enable notifications

## üîß **Environment Variables**

### **‚úÖ Required (No Changes)**

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Privy Authentication
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="your-privy-app-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID="your-privy-client-id"

# Push Chain Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHAIN_RPC_URL="https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS="0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID="42101"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

### **‚ùå No Longer Needed**

```bash
# These can be removed from .env
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHANNEL_ADDRESS=""
# PUSH_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY=""
# NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_ENV="staging"
```

---

## üéØ **Next Steps**

1. **Test the application** without Push Protocol
2. **Set up database** and Privy authentication
3. **Deploy contracts** to Push Chain Testnet (already done)
4. **Run the app** with `bun dev`
5. **Test all features** (deposits, withdrawals, etc.)

---

## üì± **User Experience Impact**

### **Before (With Push Protocol)**

- Users receive push notifications for all events
- Users can chat with partners
- Real-time updates via notification bell

### **After (Without Push Protocol)**

- Users must manually refresh to see updates
- No notification alerts
- No partner chat
- Core savings functionality unchanged

---

## ‚ú® **Summary**

Push Protocol has been **cleanly removed** from the codebase without breaking any core functionality. The application is now a **pure DeFi savings platform** with:

- ‚úÖ Smart contract multi-sig wallets
- ‚úÖ Collaborative savings goals
- ‚úÖ Deposit and withdrawal tracking
- ‚úÖ Multi-signature approvals
- ‚ùå No notifications or chat
