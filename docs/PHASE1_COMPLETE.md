# 🎉 Phase 1: Core Infrastructure - COMPLETED

## Summary

Phase 1 of the Onchain Piggy Bank Platform has been successfully completed! All core infrastructure is now in place and ready for Phase 2 development.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 1. Database Setup (DONE)

- PostgreSQL database schema successfully pushed
- All 5 tables created and ready:
  - `users` - User accounts with Privy integration
  - `piggy_banks` - Piggy bank records
  - `piggy_bank_members` - User-to-piggy bank relationships
  - `transactions` - Deposit and withdrawal tracking
  - `withdrawal_approvals` - Multi-sig approval records

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment (DONE)

- ✅ Compiled PiggyBank and PiggyBankFactory contracts
- ✅ Exported ABIs to `src/contracts/`
- ✅ **Deployed to Push Chain Testnet!**

**Deployed Contract:**

```
Factory Address: 0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9
Network: Push Chain Testnet
Chain ID: 42101
RPC: https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
```

### 3. Configuration Updates (DONE)

- ✅ Updated `src/contracts/types.ts` with Push Chain configuration
- ✅ Configured `src/providers/providers.tsx` for Push Chain (ethereum-only)
- ✅ Updated `src/hooks/usePiggyBank.ts` to use Push Chain RPC
- ✅ Hardcoded factory address with environment variable fallback

### 4. Push Protocol Installation (DONE)

- ✅ Installed `@pushprotocol/restapi@1.7.32`
- ✅ Installed `@pushprotocol/uiweb@1.7.3`
- ✅ Installed `@pushprotocol/socket@0.5.3`
- ✅ Installed `ethers@5.7.2` (required by Push Protocol)

## 📋 What You Need to Do

### Create Your `.env.local` File

Copy this template and fill in your actual values:

```bash
# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL="your-existing-postgres-url"

# Get these from https://dashboard.privy.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="your-privy-app-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID="your-privy-client-id"

# Push Chain (already configured)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHAIN_RPC_URL="https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS="0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9"

# Get these from https://app.push.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHANNEL_ADDRESS="your-channel-address"
PUSH_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY="your-channel-private-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_ENV="staging"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID="42101"
```

## 🚀 Testing the Setup

### 1. Verify Database

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

This will open Drizzle Studio to view your database tables.

### 2. Start Development Server

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the app.

### 3. Test Wallet Connection

- Click "Get Started" on the landing page
- Connect with Privy (will use Push Chain Testnet)
- Your wallet will be created on Push Chain

## 📊 Project Status

### Completed (Phase 1)

- ✅ Database setup and migrations
- ✅ Smart contract deployment to Push Chain
- ✅ Environment configuration
- ✅ Contract hooks updated
- ✅ Push Protocol dependencies installed

### Remaining Work

- ⏳ API routes for backend (Phase 2)
- ⏳ Push Protocol notification service (Phase 2)
- ⏳ Push Protocol chat integration (Phase 2)
- ⏳ Complete frontend components (Phase 3)
- ⏳ Testing and deployment (Phase 4)

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Push Chain Testnet

- **Chain ID:** 42101
- **Name:** Push Chain Testnet
- **Currency:** PUSH token
- **RPC:** https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/
- **Type:** EVM-compatible blockchain

### Factory Contract Functions

```solidity
createPiggyBank(address partner1, address partner2, uint256 goalAmount, uint256 goalDeadline)
getUserPiggyBanks(address user) returns (address[])
getTotalPiggyBanks() returns (uint256)
```

### PiggyBank Contract Features

- Multi-signature withdrawals (both partners must approve)
- Deposit tracking per partner
- Goal progress monitoring
- Event emissions for all actions

## 📚 Next Steps

Ready to continue? The next phase will focus on:

1. **Backend API Routes** - Create endpoints for all operations
2. **Push Protocol Integration** - Add notifications and chat
3. **Frontend Completion** - Connect UI to smart contracts

See `SETUP_PHASE1.md` for detailed information about what was changed.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Contract deployment failed

**Solution:** Make sure you have PUSH tokens in your wallet for gas fees

### Issue: Database connection error

**Solution:** Verify DATABASE_URL is correct in your `.env.local`

### Issue: Privy authentication not working

**Solution:** Check PRIVY_APP_ID and PRIVY_CLIENT_ID are set correctly

## 📝 Important Files Modified

1. `src/contracts/types.ts` - Chain configuration
2. `src/providers/providers.tsx` - Privy setup
3. `src/hooks/usePiggyBank.ts` - Contract interactions
4. `contracts/foundry.toml` - Already had Push Chain RPC
5. `package.json` - Push Protocol dependencies added

## 🎯 Success Criteria Met

- ✅ Database accessible and schema applied
- ✅ Smart contracts deployed to Push Chain
- ✅ Factory contract address hardcoded
- ✅ Environment properly configured
- ✅ All dependencies installed
- ✅ No compilation or linting errors
