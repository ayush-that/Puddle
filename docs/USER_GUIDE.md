## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is my money safe?**
A: Yes! Funds are stored in a smart contract on Push Chain blockchain. Both partners must approve withdrawals. No one else can access your funds.

**Q: Can I have multiple piggy banks?**
A: Yes! Create as many as you want with different partners or for different goals.

**Q: Do I need cryptocurrency?**
A: Yes, you need PUSH tokens to deposit and small amounts for gas fees (~$0.01 per transaction).

**Q: Is there a minimum deposit?**
A: No minimum, but consider gas fees. Larger, less frequent deposits are more efficient.

**Q: Can I change the goal amount later?**
A: Not currently. The goal is set at creation. But you can always save more than your goal!

### Partner Questions

**Q: What if my partner never approves withdrawals?**
A: Withdrawals require both partners to approve. Choose a trustworthy partner. This is a feature, not a bug - it prevents unauthorized withdrawals.

**Q: Can I remove my partner?**
A: No. Piggy banks are designed for commitment. Both partners have equal rights. Choose your partner carefully.

**Q: What if I lose access to my wallet?**
A: If you lose your wallet, you lose access to approve withdrawals. Your partner cannot withdraw alone. Keep wallet backup phrases safe!

**Q: My partner doesn't see the piggy bank**
A: Ensure they:

- Are using correct wallet address
- Have logged in to the app
- Check notifications for invitation
- Try refreshing the page

### Technical Questions

**Q: What blockchain is this on?**
A: Push Chain (EVM-compatible blockchain).

**Q: What are gas fees?**
A: Small fees (~$0.01-0.10) to process transactions on the blockchain. Paid in PUSH tokens.

**Q: How long do transactions take?**
A: Usually 5-10 seconds. Sometimes up to 1 minute during high network activity.

**Q: Can transactions fail?**
A: Yes, if:

- Insufficient gas
- Insufficient balance
- You reject the transaction
- Network congestion

**Q: Is my data private?**
A: Blockchain data is public. Anyone can see:

- Piggy bank address
- Balance
- Transactions

But they CAN'T see:

- Who you are
- Your name
- Your chat messages (encrypted)

### Troubleshooting

**Q: Wallet won't connect**
A: Try:

- Refresh the page
- Try different wallet provider
- Clear browser cache
- Check wallet is on Push Chain network

**Q: Transaction stuck pending**
A: Usually resolves in 1-2 minutes. If not:

- Check transaction on block explorer
- Try with higher gas
- Contact support if stuck > 10 minutes

**Q: Balance not updating**
A: Try:

- Refresh the page
- Wait 30 seconds
- Check transaction confirmed on blockchain
