# Phase 1 Setup Complete ✓

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Setup

- ✅ Database schema pushed to PostgreSQL
- ✅ All tables created: users, piggy_banks, piggy_bank_members, transactions, withdrawal_approvals

### 2. Smart Contract Deployment

- ✅ Contracts compiled successfully with Foundry
- ✅ ABIs exported to `src/contracts/`
- ✅ **PiggyBankFactory deployed to Push Chain Testnet**
  - **Contract Address:** `0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9`
  - **Network:** Push Chain Testnet (Chain ID: 42101)
  - **RPC URL:** `https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/`

### 3. Environment Configuration

- ✅ Contract types updated with Push Chain Testnet configuration
- ✅ Privy provider configured for Push Chain (ethereum-only)
- ✅ Contract hooks updated to use Push Chain RPC
- ✅ Factory address hardcoded with fallback to env variable

### 4. Push Protocol Integration

- ✅ Installed Push Protocol SDKs:
  - `@pushprotocol/restapi@1.7.32`
  - `@pushprotocol/uiweb@1.7.3`
  - `@pushprotocol/socket@0.5.3`
  - `ethers@5.7.2` (required by Push Protocol)

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with the following variables:

```bash
# Database (already configured)
DATABASE_URL="your-postgres-connection-string"

# Privy Authentication (Get from https://dashboard.privy.io)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID="your-privy-app-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_CLIENT_ID="your-privy-client-id"

# Push Chain Network
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHAIN_RPC_URL="https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org/"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FACTORY_ADDRESS="0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9"

# Push Protocol (Notifications) - Get from https://app.push.org
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_CHANNEL_ADDRESS="your-push-channel-address"
PUSH_CHANNEL_PRIVATE_KEY="your-channel-private-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUSH_ENV="staging"

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID="42101"
```

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/contracts/types.ts`**
   - Added `PUSH_CHAIN_TESTNET` chain configuration
   - Updated factory address to deployed contract
   - Added fallback values for environment variables

2. **`src/providers/providers.tsx`**
   - Removed Solana wallet support
   - Changed to `ethereum-only` wallet chain type
   - Added Push Chain Testnet as `defaultChain`

3. **`src/hooks/usePiggyBank.ts`**
   - Updated imports to use `PUSH_CHAIN_TESTNET` instead of Sepolia
   - Changed RPC URL to Push Chain Testnet
   - Updated factory address

### Files Created:

- ABIs exported: `src/contracts/PiggyBankABI.json` and `src/contracts/PiggyBankFactoryABI.json`

## Verification

To verify the setup:

1. **Database:**

   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio
   ```

2. **Smart Contract:**
   - Factory Address: `0x0E2514e3aaF9a60cBD82B5e1f996d339AD16ead9`
   - Network: Push Chain Testnet (Chain ID: 42101)

3. **Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm list @pushprotocol/restapi @pushprotocol/uiweb ethers
   ```

## Next Steps

### Phase 2: Backend API Routes

- Create API routes for user management
- Build piggy bank CRUD endpoints
- Implement deposit and withdrawal tracking
- Add authentication middleware

### Phase 3: Push Protocol Implementation

- Create notification service
- Build chat functionality
- Integrate with API routes

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration

- Complete piggy bank detail page
- Connect forms to smart contracts
- Add real-time updates

## Notes

- The factory contract is deployed and ready to create PiggyBank instances
- Push Chain Testnet requires PUSH tokens for gas fees
- All contract interactions will use the Push Chain Testnet RPC
- Push Protocol requires ethers v5 (not v6), which is now installed alongside viem
